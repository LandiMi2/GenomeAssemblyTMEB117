## Haplotype-resolved genome of heterozygous African cassava TMEB117 _(Manihot esculenta)_

This repository contains scripts of the methodology for assembling the genome of the TMEB117 cassava cultivar. Utilizing PacBio HiFi reads, we constructed a haplotype-resolved genome with an accuracy of QV > 64, N50 > 35 Mbp, and 98.9% BUSCO completeness. This represents the most precise cassava genome sequence to date. The genome is characterized by heterozygosity, encompassing over 60% repetitive elements. Our gene prediction identified more than 45,000 gene models for both haplotypes.
