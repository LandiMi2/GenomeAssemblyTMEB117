## Haplotype-resolved genome of heterozygous African cassava TMEB117 _(Manihot esculenta)_

This repository presents the results of the genome assembly of the TMEB117 cassava cultivar using PacBio HiFi reads. We achieved a haplotype-resolved genome with an accuracy of QV > 64, N50 > 35 Mbp, and 98.9% BUSCO completeness, providing the most accurate cassava genome sequence to date. The genome is heterozygous, with over 60% repetitive elements, and we have predicted more than 45,000 gene models for both haplotypes.
